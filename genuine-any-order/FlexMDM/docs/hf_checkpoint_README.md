# FlexMDM — Dream-Coder-7B

An **insertion + unmasking discrete-diffusion** model for Python code, produced by
fully fine-tuning [`Dream-org/Dream-Coder-v0-Base-7B`](https://huggingface.co/Dream-org/Dream-Coder-v0-Base-7B).
Unlike a fixed-length masked diffusion model, FlexMDM can **grow its sequence
during generation** (a learned insertion head) and unmask tokens in any order,
enabling genuinely any-order code generation.

- Paper: *From Interface to Inference: Eliciting Any-Order Inference from Any-Order Models* —
  S. Kim\*, J. Kim\*, T. Lee\*, Y. Chen\*, Y. Du, S. Kakade, S. Chen.
  [arXiv:2607.26504](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.26504).
- Code: [github.com/SeunggeunKimkr/genuine-any-order](https://github.com/SeunggeunKimkr/genuine-any-order), `FlexMDM/` subdirectory (training, data pipeline, inference, and evaluation).
- Checkpoint: `global_step_49500` (inference weights; optimizer/RNG state stripped).

## ⚠️ Loading (not a vanilla `AutoModel`)

This checkpoint hosts a Dream backbone plus FlexMDM-specific weights in
`flexmdm_extras.pt`. A bare `AutoModel.from_pretrained` returns only the backbone.
Load the full model with the FlexMDM package from the code repo:

```python
# 1) install the FlexMDM package:  pip install -e .  (in the repo's FlexMDM/ dir)
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
from flexmdm.utils import load_model_and_tokenizer

ckpt = snapshot_download("yuyuanchen0/flexmdm")
model, tokenizer = load_model_and_tokenizer(checkpoint_dir=ckpt, max_length=768)
```

`load_model_and_tokenizer` defaults to `attn_implementation="sdpa"` (works
everywhere). Pass `"flash_attention_2"` for speed (requires flash-attn), or
`"eager"` to bit-match the released evaluation traces.

For sampling (the ā = 2.9 inference-time schedule, temperature 0.1, insertion
temperature 0.6 on MBPP / 1.0 on HumanEval, 512 steps) use
`flexmdm.inference.flexmdm_generate`; see the code repo's `docs/REPRODUCE.md`.

## Model

- Base: `DreamModel` (7B; hidden 3584, 28 layers, GQA with 4 KV heads, vocab
  152064, diffusion mask id 151666), inherited unchanged.
- FlexMDM additions: a per-position **log-space insertion head**
  (`LayerNorm → Linear → GELU → Linear`, clamped to [-15, 15]) and **AdaLN time
  conditioning** on the insertion-progress coordinate.
- Schedules: **power** family, `α_t = 1−(1−t)^a` (insertion), `β_t = 1−(1−t)^(a·b)`
  (unmasking), with **a = b = 1.7**.
- Training: AdamW, LR 1e-5 (backbone) / 2e-5 (insertion head), global batch 576,
  max length 768, FSDP HYBRID_SHARD, 16× H100, ~3 days (checkpoint at step 49500).

## Training data

Fine-tuned on a five-source Hugging Face mixture (OpenCodeInstruct, opc-sft-stage2,
KodCode-V1-SFT-4o, and rStar-Coder seed/synthetic). **KodCode-V1-SFT-4o is
CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial).** Full sources, filters, and licenses — and how to
reconstruct the tokenized set — are in the code repo's `docs/DATA.md`.

## Evaluation (pass@k; n = 16 samples/task)

| Benchmark | pass@1 | pass@2 | pass@4 | pass@8 | pass@16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HumanEval  | 50.65 | 66.60 | 78.69 | 86.86 | 92.07 |
| HumanEval+ | 46.61 | 61.89 | 73.83 | 82.07 | 87.80 |
| MBPP       | 64.70 | 76.73 | 83.80 | 88.20 | 91.27 |
| MBPP+      | 54.98 | 66.11 | 73.06 | 77.38 | 80.69 |

These are the paper's Table 5 rows (extraction-robust any-of-4 grading, 30 s
test timeout). MBPP/MBPP+ decode with the count-preserving **insertion
temperature** 0.6 (HumanEval/HumanEval+: neutral 1.0); at the neutral 1.0 the
MBPP rows are 62.22 / 74.61 / 81.81 / 86.19 / 89.68 and MBPP+
52.86 / 64.38 / 72.04 / 77.00 / 80.16 — placement sharpening improves every
pass@k on both suites. Generation is deterministic (content-addressed seeds),
so the sample set is bit-reproducible — see the code repo's
`evals/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` for the exact recipe.

FlexMDM also scores substantially higher than Dream-Coder on tree-based any-order
metrics (CBC/RUB/RUB+/OBW).
